# cs372-project
[](https://github.com/ivanthewebber/csc372-program4.git)

A repo for all parts of the program 4 project in which I explored the Go programming language.

I chose Go (a.k.a. Golang) because I was interested in a high-performance langauge which was a little more established than Rust.

To learn more about Go see the [language study!](language_study.md)

For an example of Go in action see my [Rot 13 Program](ROT13.go)

Additional information and downloads of Go's compiler are available at [golang.org](golang.org)

# Creative Program
For the creative program portion of the project I made a RESTful Web App conceptually simmilar to Google's tasks. [See the markdown](github.com/ivanthewebber/cs372-project/creative-program/README.md)
