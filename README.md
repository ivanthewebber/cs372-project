# csc372-program3
A repo for all parts of our program 3 project in which we will explore the GO programming language.

We chose GO (a.k.a. GOlang) because we were interested in a high-performance langauge which was a little more established than Rust.

# Creative Program
We can add a description of the program we make in part 3 of the assignment here.
